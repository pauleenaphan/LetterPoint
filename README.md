# Letter Point
Letter Point is a website that lets you easily keep track of your Scrabble letters and scores. Iâ€™ve been playing Scrabble a lot with a friend, and we usually just use calculators. I thought it would be fun to have a tool that calculates the points for you as soon as you enter a word.

[Deployed by Vercel](https://letterpoint.vercel.app/)

## Features
- Click on an individual letter to apply a double or triple letter score.
- Click on the multiplier to double or triple the entire word score.
- Points are calculated automatically in real time.
